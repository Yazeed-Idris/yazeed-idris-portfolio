# README 
This project was made to make my portfolio (Yazeed Idris). However, the project is highly customizable and can be used to make any portfolio. The project is still in development and I will be adding more features to it.

## Installation

first you need to install the dependencies

```bash
npm install

## Usage

To change the theme colors, you can change the colors in the tailwind configuration file `/tailwind.config.js` file.
To change the content of the website, you can change the data in `/public/my-data.json`.
